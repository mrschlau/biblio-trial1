<!--COMMENTARY FOR PROFESSOR
 To:    Prof. Mel
 From:  Matt
 Info:  In the event that you inspect this sourcecode, I thought I should let you know that this homepage is an altered version (to meet the requirements of this assignment) of one of my old websites that is no longer hosted online (unless you check the internet's wayback machine).  Thanks for taking the time to look at the sourcecode!  Also, although it's old sourcecode, I did revamp it a LOT (I originally wrote it when I was 10 years old and hadn't known how to center pages and such back then.  Also, some of the code syntax that was accepted by then-modern day browsers in 2000 doesn't work in 2011, so some adjustments were necessary just to make it functional again).

                                    Biblioworm is a play on words, merging "bibliophile" with "book worm".  Both of these terms are used to describe people who enjoy books a lot.  As such, welcome to the site that loves lovers of books, Biblioworm!</TD></TR>

                                    Biblioworm is still in it's infancy and isn't too fancy yet, but that doesn't mean there aren't any features for you to enjoy!  Aside from the random quote generator (over 100 supported - see new ones by refreshing this page), and the XML links provided around the site (for you to gain insight about what data is passed between the site's databases), this website also hosts two databases for worms (users) and books.  At the top of this site (below the quote generator) you will see two links: one for creating a worm account and another for uploading book information.  You'll also find a couple of hidden easter eggs on this homepage if you look around hard enough (hint1: find the worm | hint2: every snowflake is unique).</TD></TR>

                                    A better question would be, why shouldn't you?  No doubt you're curious about Biblioworm and want to see how it works, otherwise you wouldn't have navigated to this website or read this far down.  Seriously though, the benefit of having an account at Biblioworm is the ability to further collaborate about literature.  After you see all the great works listed on Biblioworm you'll no doubt be inclined to look a few of them up for your own personal reading, suggest them to others, and add a few books of your own liking to Bibliworm's ever growing database of books!</TD></TR>

                                    It's pretty simple really.  All you have to do is navigate to the top of this page and create yourself a worm account (a user account).  Once you've made your worm account, be sure to take note of your worm id, which will be be the the only integer listed on the far right in your address bar.  After which you should return to the homepage and navigate to the books listing link, where you can then add book information.  Be sure to add your worm id (the number you took note of earlier) to the contributing worm id field, so that Biblioworm can better track which worms contributed particular books.</TD></TR>

                                    Biblioworm was developed using Ruby on Rails to complete a class assignment in software engineering.  It's meant to showcase my having basic knowledge of how to design websites using ruby on rails.  The sad truth is that this site likely won't ever be updated again, but I do hope you enjoy your stay nonetheless.  Additionally, if you take a liking to any of the images, music, quotes, or javascript on this page, then feel free to check out the sourcecode for this homepage.

                                    I'm not in the practice of leaving my information on the internet if it can be helped (often times spiders and other roaming bots will pick-up phone numbers and e-mail addresses that they add to accounts).  Ruby on Rails scaffolding actually comes with support to prevent spiders from collecting this very information, but given this site is unlikely to be maintained it's reasonable to expect that more advanced spiders will come along and figure out a way to mine out my data.  As such, I will not be leaving any of my contact information here.  If you care to track me down on the world wide web however, then one of my many pseudonyms of which you may try and track is "Rahl".</TD></TR>

 Info:  In the event that you inspect this sourcecode, I thought I should let you know that it is an altered version (to meet the requirements of this assignment) of one of my old websites that is no longer hosted online (unless you check the internet's wayback machine, which you'll find it there).  As such, you will find references to "nbatime", "Rahl", and "Matthewrs_Rahl" littering the sourcecode.  Do not be alarmed by this, as that is me.  And if you'd like me to verify this, then just let me know and I'll hop on my old nbatime@aol.com account and send you an e-mail as proof.  Thanks for taking the time to look at the sourcecode!

    Biblioworm is still in it's infancy and isn't too fancy yet, but that doesn't mean there aren't any features for you to enjoy!  Aside from the random quote generator at the top which refreshes every few seconds (viva la ajax!), this website also hosts two databases for worms (users) and books.  At the top of this site you will see a link for creating a worm account and to upload book information.</TD></TR>

    A better question would be, why shouldn't you?  No doubt you're curious about Biblioworm and want to see how it works, otherwise you wouldn't have navigated to this website or read this far down.  Seriously though, the benefit of having an account at Biblioworm is the ability to participate in collaboration about literature.  After you see all the great works listed on Biblioworm you'll no doubt be inclined to look a few of them up for your own personal reading, suggest them to others, and add a few to Bibliworm's ever growing database of books too!</TD></TR>

      It's pretty simple really.  All you have to do is navigate to the top of this page and create yourself a worm (user) account.  When you do, make sure to take note of your worm (user) id, which will be be the the only integer listed (at the end) at the end of your address (in your address bar).  After which, you should return to the homepage and navigate to the books listing, where you can then add book info.  Be sure to add your worm id to the contributing worm id field, so that future users can track who made what additions.</TD></TR>

    Biblioworm was developed using Ruby on Rails to complete a class assignment in software engineering.  It's meant to showcase my having basic knowledge of how to design websites using ruby on rails.  The sad truth is, this site likely won't ever be updated again, but I do hope you enjoy your stay nonetheless.</TD></TR>

    I'm not in the practice of leaving my information on the internet if it can be helped (often times spiders and other roaming bots will pick-up phone numbers and e-mail addresses that they add to accounts).  Ruby on Rails scaffolding actually comes with support to prevent spiders from collecting this very information, but given this site is unlikely to be maintained it's reasonable to expect spiders will be built smarter to work-around these defenses.  As such, I will not be leaving my information here.  If you care to track me down using one of my many pseudonyms however, you might have luck with "Rahl".</TD></TR>

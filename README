Welcome to Biblioworm!  A merging of the terms "bibliophile" and "book worm".

You're currently reading the README for Biblioworm.

All you need to know about Biblioworm at this time is that it has two databases (worms [users] and books).  Books belong to worms and worms can have many books.  That being said, no activate sessions are maintained and validations of the worm-to-book relationship are not maintained at this point in development.

The goal of the website is for worms (users) to make accounts and upload information about books they've enjoyed, heard about, or would recommend to other worms.  The behavior of a worm is that he/she is likely to upload a lot of similar books, thus an attribution for books entitled "genre" was added, as well as the ability to view the contributing worm id of the worm who added the book - this allows others worms to better look up specific genres of books or to see the books uploaded by a particular worm.  Of course, validations have been included for input (e.g. contributing worm id is limited to 3 characters, thus limiting to 999 worms on the site - also synopsis is limited to 500 words).  Some of the error messages were also tweaked to make greater sense, in the event that the website messes up when given a worm request or another party tries to break the site.

I hope you enjoy your stay at Biblioworm and that you add lots of books!  :)
